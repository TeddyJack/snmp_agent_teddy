1) Strict row indexing in tables
Now function write_row() allows to create row with any index (if row doesn't exist), that might be confusing. Existing row indexes are stored inside table-object.
Should forbid this function to create rows, allow only to rewrite contents. New rows should be created by append_row() function. Table-object should store just number of rows.

2) "rowStatus" column in tables
Now this column MUST be present in MIB file. For manager that column is unnecessary. MIB file is little bit dirty.
The other way - rowStatus MUST be absent in MIB file, and created automatically with code. MIB file is clean.
Problem is some example MIB files have that column, some of them - don't.
Maybe I should detect presence of rowStatus-column of every table and create it if not present? Don't know how to detect yet.

3) Erase and create SNMP agent again
> snmpEngine.close_dispatcher()   # yeah that closes the dispatcher, good
> snmpEngine.open_dispatcher()    # but opening after closing doesn't work
I need to be able to fully shutdown and start SNMP agent in runtime! How to do it?
Also function snmpEngine.open_dispatcher() literally running forever. If it executed in separate thread, that thread never stops.
