1) When to create scalar instances
In current version scalar instances are created at the beginning (in the __init__())
Code is simple. But if manager requests scalar value before it was firstly written, he will get timeout error.
The other way is to create instance in function write_scalar() at the first writing (using try-except).
Code is more complex. But if manager requests scalar value before it was firstly written, he will get "no such instance" response.
Don't know which option is better.

2) Strict row indexing in tables
Now function write_row() allows to create row with any index (if row doesn't exist), that might be confusing. Existing row indexes are stored inside table-object.
Should forbid this function to create rows, allow only to rewrite contents. New rows should be created by append_row() function. Table-object should store just number of rows.
